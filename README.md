# compound-proposition-evaluator
This program takes a user input for a compound proposition consisting of operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. and up to 5 variables which can be true or false, then calculates the final result using order of operations.

Use "/\\" for AND, "\\/" for OR, "~" for NOT, "->" as a conditional operator and "<->" for a biconditional operator.

There are multiple "output" text files which each contain a sample run of the program showcasing different functionalities.
