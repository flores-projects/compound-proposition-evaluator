COMPOUND PROPOSITION EVALUATOR
Written by Jose M Flores

This program takes a user input for a compound proposition consisting of operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. and up to 5 variables which can be true or false, then calculates the final result using order of operations.

Use "/\\" for AND, "\\/" for OR, "~" for NOT, "->" as a conditional operator and "<->" for a biconditional operator.

There are multiple "output" text files which each contain a sample run of the program showcasing different functionalities, and documentation explaining step by step how the program uses two stacks to convert the user input infix expression to postfix and then calculate a final result.
